# DeFi Builder Plugin Marketplace

The DeFi Builder Plugin Marketplace is a dynamic ecosystem that bridges the gap of developer monetization. It empowers module creators and users by offering a marketplace where each plugin is represented as an NFT that can be bought or rented. This introduces SaaS-like distribution mechanics and enhances the Safe{CORE} Protocol and other modular architectures. Developers can monetize their creations, and users gain access to a wide range of modules to enhance their DeFi experience.
